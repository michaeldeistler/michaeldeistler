## Hello, World!

I am a PhD candidate at the [Max Planck International Research School for Intelligent Systems](https://imprs.is.mpg.de) and the [University of TÃ¼bingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/). I am part of the [Machine Learning in Science lab](https://www.mackelab.org) led by Jakob Macke.

I work on machine learning tools for scientific discovery. Together with many other amazing people, I am developer and maintainer of the following two toolboxes:  
- [sbi](https://github.com/sbi-dev/sbi), a PyTorch toolbox for simulation-based Bayesian inference and
- [Jaxley](http://github.com/jaxleyverse/jaxley), a differentiable simulator for biophysically detailed neuron models in JAX.

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://x.com/deismic_) or [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q24H-zYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
